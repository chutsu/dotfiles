# chutsu's dotfiles

**WARNING**: DO NOT BLINDLY USE MY CONFIGURATIONS, THEY CAN BE DANGEROUS TO
YOUR NEEDS!

This dotfile repo contains a backup of my custom configuration files. Of
particular interest to you is probably `init.sh`, this shell script essentially
creates all kinds of symlinks to make the configuration files active on the
system.

This dotfile repo contains configuration for:

    - bash
    - tmux
    - vim
    - i3
    - vimperator
