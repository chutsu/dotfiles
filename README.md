chutsu's dotfiles
=================

**WARNING**: DO NOT BLINDLY USE MY CONFIGURATIONS, THEY CAN BE DANGEROUS TO
YOUR NEEDS!

This dotfile repo contains a backup of my custom configuration files. Of
particular interest to you is probably `init.sh`, this shell script essentially
creates all kinds of symlinks to make the configuration files active on the
system.

This dotfile repo contains configuration for things like `bash`, `i3`,
`arandr`, `tmux`, `vifm`, `vim`, ...


Install
=======

For the lazy:

```
# Deployment version
curl -L https://git.io/fjBqV > setup.bash && bash setup.bash mini

# Full version
curl -L https://git.io/fjBqV > setup.bash && bash setup.bash full
```
